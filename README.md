Liveduino
=========

A project that controls Ableton Live tracks via MIDI from an Arduino. In my specific project, I created a big array of button pads made out of album covers that you step on to trigger clips in Ableton.

## Software + Hardware + DIY Circuit

Liveduino connects an Arduino to Ableton Live to do some MIDI controlling that is specific to Live and won't work with any other software. The goal of this project and of this repo is really to provide instructions to build the very same project that I built. This assumes that you have same software and hardware as me. 

### What I'm working with

 * OSX 10.9 Mavericks
 * Ableton Live 9 Suite
 * Arduino Uno
 * Arduino IDE

 If you have all this stuff, you should be able to rebuild this project.

 I have a lot of things to do. Read the TODO.md file to see what I'm working on and what features I'm thinking about adding.
